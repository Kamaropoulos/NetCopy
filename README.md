# NetCopy
A Cross-Platform Clipboard Sharing Utility  

Did you ever need to copy-paste text from a device to an another?    
Yeah, everyone did at some point.  
The problem is that you couldn't. So you just typed it on the other device...    
NetCopy is a small, cross-platform utility that comes to change that!  
Even if you use a PC, an Android Phone or an iOS device your clipboard will follow you everywhere you go!
